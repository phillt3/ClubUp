# Club Up

Welcome to **Club Up**! This iOS app is for analytical golfers who factor in even the tiniest details when playing around the course. This application was a fusion of one of my favorite sports and my love for app building, and allowed me to explore new mobile development techniques.

In the process of creating **Club Up**, I designed specialized SwiftData models for representing golf clubs, calculations, and weather data, I formulated equations to calculate the impact environmental variables would have on distance, composed algorithms to quickly and accurately determine the best club for a player to hit, and designed unique and intiutive UI to fit the functionality I was striving for.

Be sure to visit my Youtube channel for an on course demo and overview of **Club Up**.


## Features

- True Distance Calculation: Determine the true distance between you and the hole in your preferred unit, factoring in slope, lie, temperature, wind speed/direction, altitude, and more.
- Create Your Virtual Golf Bag: Tailor your club recommendations to your game and create a virtual representation of each of your clubs so that the app can give you the right club to hit, every time.
- User First Experience: Configure the app to your liking, with dark mode/light mode support, a full Spanish version, and multiple settings to configure your **Club Up** experience.
